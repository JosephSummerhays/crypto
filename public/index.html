            <h2 class="alignright">Purpose of this website!</h2>
              <p>
                As our society gets more and more advanced there is a continualy
                growing demand for specialists in the fields of mathmatics
                and the sciences. Kids who find their passion in this area early
                on have an advantage . <br>
                This site is meant to be an introduction into how math can play
                a role in the real world and also be fun for kids in elementary school.
                all they need is a basic understanding of prime factorization!

            <h2>How cryptography works</h2>
            <p>
              While the field of cryptography involves very high level mathematics
              in the nitty gritty details, the "big picture" of how it works is
              very simple. The only really way to factor a number is to guess and
              check. Usually we start with a small prime number and get bigger.
              To factor a large number, like 5183, we'd have to guess 20 different
              primes before we landed on one that worked.<br>
              Knowing this we can make an encryption algorithm that's as hard to
              crack as a product is to factor. We'll encrypt a message using the
              product of two prime numbers (the "public Key"), and make it impossible to decript
              without the prime factorization (the "private Key").

            <h2>The Game</h2>
            <p>
              Have the teacher sign in as the Host (by clicking the button below).
              The teacher will send a message to the server, and encrypt it by
              supplying two prime numbers. Have the Students sign in as the "Hackers"
              who are trying to crack the code and get the decrypted message.
              Once the Host has sent the message the Hackers will need to refresh
              their pages to recieve it and begin to crack the code!
